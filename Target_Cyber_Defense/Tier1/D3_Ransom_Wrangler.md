Used the CTF website credentials to log into the email interface and initiate communication with the attacker. The inbox displayed a ransom message from the attacker.

Initial attempts using a passive/pleading tone were ineffective. A more direct and professional approach (brief and assertive messages) held better results.

### ðŸš© Flag 1 â€“ Verify the Breach

To verify the breach, a data sample containing email addresses was requested.

**Email sent:**
> Provide a sample of the data you stole as proof. No action will be taken without this proof.

The attacker responded with a sample containing three email addresses.
- V@yahoo.com.sg
- Frog-cow.a@rambler.ru
- j-h.h49706@hotmail.it

### ðŸš© Flag 2 â€“ Negotiate Ransom Reduction

The attacker initially demanded 45 BTC. A counter-offer was made to reduce the demand to less than 30 BTC.

**Email sent:**
> Based on sample data, we cannot give you 45 BTC. Lower the amount for further action. We can offer you 20 BTC.

The attacker accepted the reduced amount.

### ðŸš© Flag 3 â€“ Extend the Deadline

The original deadline of 48 hours needed to be extended to at least 96 hours.

**Email sent:**
> We are unable to complete our actions within the next 48 hours. Our team needs more time. We can offer you the deadline of 100 hours.

The attacker responded, countering with a 96-hour extension instead.
