Given 2 images, need to use information found to construct the flag. First part of the flag is the cafe name and the second part os the street name.

<img src="../images/Cafe_Confidential1.png" width="325" hspace="20"/> <img src="../images/Cafe_Confidential2.png" width="425"/> 

Reverse google search the second image to see it is a building of **Harrods**. Now reverse google search the first image with the word Harrods to find a bakery nearby called Parker’s on Lowndes street.

CTF Flag: **C1{Peter’s_Lowndes}**
